    <h1>Lab 2 - MyArrayList</h1>
    <h3>CSCI 151<br>
      Spring, 2018<br>
      Due:&nbsp; 11:59 pm, Sunday, February 25 </h3>
    <p> In this assignment, you will create your first Java class, an
      implementation of the ArrayList data structure from the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/collections/index.html">Java
Collections


















        Framework</a>. You will also learn how to use Generics and get
      some practice writing test cases for your program. The purpose of
      this lab is to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn how to write your own Java class,<br>
      </li>
      <li>Begin learning about Java Collections,</li>
      <li>Learn how to write a generic class,<br>
      </li>
      <li>Learn how to use JUnit to do proper testing of a class.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Part 1:&nbsp; Writing the MyArrayList class</h2>
    <p> You'll be constructing your very own implementation of the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>
      data structure so that you understand its inner workings. You
      should use the prefix <em>My</em> in the class name so that you
      don't accidentally use the standard ArrayList in your testing.
      However, you will be matching its behavior, so when in doubt, you
      can refer back to the ArrayList documentation for clarification
      and/or use an ArrayList as a working reference solution.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Your MyArrayList class will implement the Java <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html">List</a>
      interface.&nbsp; The List interface contains more than 20
      methods.&nbsp; Your class will contain a subset of these methods.<br>
      <br>
      Write MyArrayList as a <span style="font-style: italic;">generic</span>
      class.&nbsp; That means that the type of objects to be stored in
      the list is specified when the list is declared or
      instantiated.&nbsp; Use the header line<br>
    </p>
    <pre class="boxed code prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted"><span class="kwd">public</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">class</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">MyArrayList</span><span class="pun">&lt;</span><span class="typ">E</span><span class="pun">&gt;</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">extends</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">AbstractList</span><span class="pun">&lt;</span><span class="typ">E</span><span class="pun">&gt;</span></pre>
    <br>
    Note that you are extending <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/AbstractList.html">AbstractList</a>
    instead of implementing List.&nbsp; AbstractList is an abstract
    class contained in the java.util package.&nbsp; It contains stub
    routines for most of the List methods, so you don't have to
    implement the entire List interface, only the methods indicated in
    parts 2 and 3 of the lab below.&nbsp; (Two methods which remain
    abstract in AbstractList are <tt>get</tt> and <tt>size</tt>.&nbsp;
    You won't be able to compile your class successfully until you write
    implementations for these two methods.)&nbsp; Since AbstractList
    implements List, your class will, too.<br>
    <br>
    AbstractList is in the java.util package, so you need to write&nbsp;
    "import java.util.*;" at the beginning of your class file.<br>
    <br>
    <em>Note:</em>&nbsp; Don't use any of the methods from the Arrays
    class in your implementation, with the exception of Arrays.toString,
    which you may use for testing if you like.<br>
    <br>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>Private data </h3>
    <p>Define the following member variables in your MyArrayList class:</p>
    <dl class="code">
      <dt>int size</dt>
      <dd>the number of items currently stored in the list (which may
        differ from the list's current capacity)</dd>
      <dt>E[] data</dt>
      <dd>the array where the items in the list will actually be stored<br>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    The list items should be stored in consecutive array positions,
    starting with position 0.&nbsp; For example, if the list contains 4
    elements, they should be stored in array positions 0, 1, 2, and
    3.&nbsp; (There should not be any gaps.)<br>
    <br>
    Note the difference between the length of the array (data.length)
    and the size of the list.&nbsp; The array may not always be
    completely filled up; we allow some extra space for future
    additions.<br>
    <br>
    <h3> Constructors</h3>
    <p>Recall that the purpose of a constructor is to initialize an
      object's instance variables.&nbsp; In this case, your constructors
      must initialize <tt>size</tt> and <tt>data</tt>.&nbsp; Write the
      following constructors in your MyArrayList class:</p>
    <dl class="code">
      <dt>MyArrayList(int startLength) </dt>
      <dd><tt>startLength</tt> is the initial capacity of the data
        array.</dd>
      <dt>MyArrayList() </dt>
      <dd>Use a default initial capacity of 5.&nbsp; <em>NOTE:</em>&nbsp;

















        Avoid duplicating code from your other constructor in this one,
        by having this constructor call the other with an appropriate
        argument (that is, use <tt>this(5)</tt>). </dd>
    </dl>
    <p> Note:&nbsp; Java does not permit the instantiation of an array
      of a generic type.&nbsp; To create an array of <tt>E</tt>
      objects, you need to create an array of type <tt>Object</tt>,
      then cast it into an array of type <tt>E</tt>.&nbsp; For example,
      to create an <tt>E</tt> array with 5 elements, you would write:<br>
    </p>
    <pre class="boxed code prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted"><span class="typ">E</span><span class="pun">[]</span><span class="pln"> someArray </span><span class="pun">= (</span><span class="typ">E</span><span class="pln"></span><span class="pun">[]) </span><span class="kwd">new</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">Object</span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="pln">5</span><span class="pun">];</span></pre>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    This code will generate a warning message from the compiler.&nbsp;
    You can (and should) suppress the message by writing the following
    statement immediately before the method in which the cast operation
    occurs:<br>
    <br>
    <pre class="boxed code prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted"><span class="lit">@SuppressWarnings</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"unchecked"</span><span class="pun">)</span></pre>
    <br>
    <h3>A private method</h3>
    <p>Write a private method called <tt>resize</tt> that <b>doubles</b>
      the length of the array by creating a new array of twice the
      current length, copying the data from the current array to the new
      one, and then resetting the data pointer to point to the new
      array.&nbsp; (The old array will eventually be garbage collected.)<br>
    </p>
    <dl class="code">
      <dt>private void resize() </dt>
      <dd>Create a new array that is twice the size of the current one
        (use <code>data.length</code>) </dd>
      <dd>Copy all of the old data into the new array </dd>
      <dd>Set <code class="prettyprint lang-java">this.data</code> to
        be your new array </dd>
    </dl>
    <p> </p>
    <p>While you are testing the class, it's a good idea to have the
      resize method print a message indicating the old and new
      lengths.&nbsp; You can remove the print statement when it seems to
      be working.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Some public methods (more to follow)</h3>
    <p>Implement the following methods in your MyArrayList class</p>
    <dl class="code">
      <dt>int size(); </dt>
      <dd>Return the number of items stored in the list, <em>not</em>
        the maximum capacity of the underlying array (i.e, not the size
        of the data array that you get from <code class="prettyprint
          lang-java prettyprinted"><span class="pln">data</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">length</span></code>).
      </dd>
      <dt>void add(int index, E element); </dt>
      <dd>Adds the element at the specified index, shifting everything
        else right one space. </dd>
      <dd>You are allowed to add at any index location up to and
        including the current size. (<code class="prettyprint lang-java
          prettyprinted"><span class="pln">index</span><span class="pun">==</span><span class="pln">size</span></code> is the first unused
        location.) Resize the array if necessary. </dd>
      <dd>Throw an <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/IndexOutOfBoundsException.html">IndexOutOfBoundsException</a>
        if the index is not within the allowed range, with a statement
        like this: </dd>
      <dd>
        <pre class="boxed code prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted"><span class="kwd">throw</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">new</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span><span class="pun">();</span></pre>
      </dd>
      <dd>or even better:</dd>
      <dd>
        <pre class="boxed code prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted"><span class="kwd">throw</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">new</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"Index Out of Bounds! You tried to get "</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">+</span><span class="pln">
index </span><span class="pun">+</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">" but the size is "</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">+</span><span class="pln"> size </span><span class="pun">);</span></pre>
      </dd>
      <dd>or something to that effect. </dd>
      <dt>boolean add(E element); </dt>
      <dd>Adds an item to the end of the array.&nbsp; (Hint: you can use
        the previous method -- don't just copy the code from there.) </dd>
      <dd>This method returns <tt>true</tt> if the item was
        added.&nbsp; Since you will always be adding the item specified,
        you should always return true. </dd>
      <dt>E get(int index); </dt>
      <dd>Return the value stored at the given index. </dd>
      <dd>Throw an <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/IndexOutOfBoundsException.html">IndexOutOfBoundsException</a>
        if the index is not within the allowed range.&nbsp; Note that
        this range is smaller than the range allowed for <tt>add()</tt>.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <br>
    <h2>Part 2 - Testing with JUnit</h2>
    <p>We've noted in class that today's software is extremely large and
      complex.&nbsp; Object-oriented programming deals with this size
      and complexity by breaking down large programs into small modules
      (i.e., objects).&nbsp; Software engineers have found that it is
      not only wise to write their software in small chunks, but also to
      test it that way.&nbsp; That is, as each class is written, a set
      of tests is written to verify that it is working properly.&nbsp;
      This is sometimes called "unit testing."&nbsp; So before you
      proceed to the rest of your MyArrayList implementation, you will
      test the code you have written thus far, using a Java testing
      framework called JUnit.<br>
    </p>
    <p>As a side note, some people take this even further, and practice
      "Test Driven Development."&nbsp; As the name suggests, instead of
      designing your program to fit some guidelines and THEN deciding
      what tests are adequate, test driven development FIRST decides on
      a set of tests that you want your program to "pass", and only then
      do you design the program to pass those tests. You can read more
      about this software development technique in many places,
      including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Wikipedia</a>.<br>
      <br>
      The "old" way of testing was to write test cases in a main method
      somewhere.&nbsp; Although this approach is convenient and simple,
      it can be ineffective:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is no explicit concept of a test passing or failing.
        Typically, the program outputs messages simply with <tt>System.out.println</tt>;
        the user has to look at this and decide if it is correct.</li>
      <li><tt>main</tt> has access to <tt>protected</tt> and <tt>private</tt>
        members and methods. While you may want to test the inner
        workings of a class, many tests are really about testing an
        object's interface to the outside world.</li>
      <li>There is no mechanism to collect results in a structured
        fashion.</li>
      <li>There is no replicability. After each test run, a person has
        to examine and interpret the results.</li>
    </ul>
    The JUnit framework addresses these issues, and more.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>JUnit<br>
    </h3>
    <p>JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java that is supported in
      Eclipse.&nbsp; It enables developers to easily create Java test
      cases.&nbsp; It provides a comprehensive assertion facility to
      verify expected versus actual results.&nbsp; We will use it in
      this lab to develop tests for the MyArrayList class.&nbsp; You'll
      be strongly encouraged to continue using it as we write other
      classes in future assignments.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It is simple to write a JUnit test case in Eclipse:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right click on your MyArrayList class file in the package view
        in the left pane, and select <b>New &gt; JUnit Test Case</b>. </li>
      <li>Select the radio button <b>New JUnit 4 test</b> and click <b>Next</b>.
      </li>
      <li>Name your test <b>MyArrayListTest</b><br>
      </li>
      <li>Do <b>not</b> select anything in the <b>Which method stubs
          would you like to create?</b> section.</li>
      <li>Click <b>Browse...</b> in the <b>Class under test: </b>section.</li>
      <li>Type <b>MyArrayList</b> in the text field in the dialog that
        came up.&nbsp; Select <b>MyArrayList</b> in the list below.</li>
      <li>Select <b>Next.</b></li>
      <li>Select the checkbox to the left of <b>MyArrayList&lt;E&gt;</b>.
        This should select all the methods that we will test initially.
        You will be adding tests by hand later.</li>
      <li>Select <b>Finish</b></li>
      <li>When it asks if you want to add JUnit4 to the build path,
        click <b>Perform the following action</b>.</li>
      <li>You should now have another class file, named something like
        MyArrayListTest.java. Check it out. Some things to notice: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>All test methods are preceded by <tt>@Test</tt>. You can
          add your own test method provided you use this tag. </li>
        <li>All test methods start with <tt>test</tt>, followed by the
          name of the method that is to be tested. For example, <tt>testSize</tt>
          will test the <tt>size</tt> method. If a method has multiple
          method signatures (with different parameters) then the test
          method name will also list the types of the parameters. For
          example, <tt>testAddE()</tt> and <tt>testAddIntE()</tt> test
          the <tt>add(E element)</tt> and <tt>add(int index, E
            element)</tt> methods, respectively. </li>
        <li>You can use the <tt>@Ignore</tt> tag (instead of the <tt>@Test</tt>
          tag) to specify JUnit to ignore the test method that follows.
          Otherwise, JUnit will run the test methods in an arbitrary
          order (so each one should be self-contained.) </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    It is also simple to run your tests:
    <ul>
      <li>Right-click your new test class and select <b>Run As &gt;
          JUnit Test</b>. </li>
      <li>The results of the tests are displayed in the "JUnit
        View".&nbsp; Right now all your tests should be failing, as we
        haven't implemented any yet. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    So what can you actually do in these tests?&nbsp; Let's walk through
    some examples:
    <ul>
      <li>To test that your empty constructor is working correctly,
        replace the <tt>fail(...)</tt> method call with the following
        code in the <tt>testMyArrayList()</tt> method:
        <pre class="boxed code prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted"><span class="typ">MyArrayList</span><span class="pun">&lt;</span><span class="typ">Integer</span><span class="pun">&gt;</span><span class="pln"> test </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">new</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">MyArrayList</span><span class="pun">&lt;</span><span class="typ">Integer</span><span class="pun">&gt;();</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="typ">ArrayList</span><span class="pun">&lt;</span><span class="typ">Integer</span><span class="pun">&gt;</span><span class="pln">   standard </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">new</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">ArrayList</span><span class="pun">&lt;</span><span class="typ">Integer</span><span class="pun">&gt;();</span><span class="pln">
assertEquals</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"Size after construction"</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> standard</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">size</span><span class="pun">(),</span><span class="pln"> test</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">size</span><span class="pun">());</span></pre>
        Basically, we construct an arraylist with our implementation,
        and compare it to that of Java's. Ideally the size of our new
        arraylist is 0, which should be the same as
        standard.size().&nbsp; Observe that this is a stand-alone test;
        it constructs the array lists it needs, and is disjoint from the
        other tests. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>To see what would happen if your test failed, change the last
        line of code to
        <pre class="boxed code prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted"><span class="pln">assertEquals</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"Size after construction"</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">2</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> test</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">size</span><span class="pun">());</span></pre>
        Rerun the test (press the green play-button icon with the yellow
        arrow), and see how the test fails. Notice that the failure
        trace conveniently tells you what value you were expecting (2),
        and what value you actually got (0).&nbsp; Nice!&nbsp; Change it
        back before proceeding. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>To test that your size method is working correctly, replace
        the <tt>fail(...)</tt> method call with the following code in
        the <tt>testSize</tt> method:
        <pre class="boxed code prettyprint lang-java prettyprinted"><span class="typ">MyArrayList</span><span class="pun">&lt;</span><span class="typ">Integer</span><span class="pun">&gt;</span><span class="pln"> test </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">new</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">MyArrayList</span><span class="pun">&lt;</span><span class="typ">Integer</span><span class="pun">&gt;();</span><span class="pln"> 
</span><span class="typ">ArrayList</span><span class="pun">&lt;</span><span class="typ">Integer</span><span class="pun">&gt;</span><span class="pln">   standard </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">new</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">ArrayList</span><span class="pun">&lt;</span><span class="typ">Integer</span><span class="pun">&gt;();</span><span class="pln">
assertEquals</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">"Size after construction"</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> standard</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">size</span><span class="pun">(),</span><span class="pln"> test</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">size</span><span class="pun">());</span><span class="pln">
test</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">add</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="lit">0</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="lit">5</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
standard</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">add</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="lit">0</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="lit">5</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
assertEquals</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">"Size after add"</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> standard</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">size</span><span class="pun">(),</span><span class="pln"> test</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">size</span><span class="pun">());</span></pre>
        <br>
        Now run the test to verify that your size method is working
        properly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>JUnit methods</h3>
    The JUnit framework contains many useful methods that you can call
    in your tests.&nbsp; Here is a list of some of them: <br>
    <dl class="code">
      <dt>assertTrue([message], boolean condition) </dt>
      <dt>assertFalse([message], boolean condition) </dt>
      <dd>Checks that the boolean condition is true (or false), if not,
        displays the message. </dd>
      <dt>assertEquals([message], expected, actual) </dt>
      <dt>assertEquals([message], expected, actual, tolerance) </dt>
      <dd>Tests that float or double values match. The tolerance is the
        number of decimals which must be the same. </dd>
      <dt>assertNull([message], object) </dt>
      <dd>Checks that the object is null. </dd>
      <dt>assertNotNull([message], object) </dt>
      <dd>Checks that the object is not null. </dd>
      <dt>assertSame([String], expected, actual) </dt>
      <dd>Checks that both variables refer to the same object. </dd>
      <dt>assertNotSame([String], expected, actual) </dt>
      <dd>Checks that both variables refer to different objects. </dd>
    </dl>
    <br>
    For a full list of assert methods, go <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/index.html?org/junit/Assert.html">here</a>
    (you may need to click on the Assert class in the left lower pane).<br>
    <br>
    You can even test that the correct exceptions are thrown by changing
    the <tt>@Test</tt> tag before your test method.&nbsp; For example,
    to test the exception that should be thrown by the add method when
    adding "off the left" of the list, we could use this code:
    <pre class="boxed code prettyprint lang-java">@Test(expected=IndexOutOfBoundsException.class)
public void testForAddLeftException() throws Exception {
    MyArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; test = new MyArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    test.add(-1, 5);
}
</pre>
    <br>
    To test the exception that should be thrown by the add method when
    adding "off the right" of the list, we would use a second method:<br>
    <br>
    <pre class="boxed code prettyprint lang-java">@Test(expected=IndexOutOfBoundsException.class)
public void testForAddRightException() throws Exception {
    MyArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; test = new MyArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    test.add(test.size()+1, 5);
}
</pre>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Writing your own tests</h3>
    <p>Now it's your turn.&nbsp; In each of the following test methods,
      implement the recommended test.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="boxed"> <b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp; Some of the these tests ask
      you to read some input data from a file.&nbsp; You can do this by
      using a Scanner created to read from a File, as follows:<br>
      <br>
      Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("test1.txt"));<br>
      <br>
      Then just use the Scanner in the usual way.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>testAddE()</tt>:&nbsp; Tests your constructor, the
        single-parameter add method (which should call the two-parameter
        add method), and the get method.&nbsp; Under the covers, it will
        also test your private resize method. This also tests adds to
        the end of the list and adds when the list is at capacity.
        <p>Create a MyArrayList of Strings and an ArrayList of
          Strings.&nbsp; Read the file <a href="http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~jdonalds/151/labs/test1.txt">test1.txt</a>
          and insert each line of the file, one at a time, into both
          lists<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>using their
          respective <tt>add(element)</tt> methods.&nbsp; Assert that
          the sizes of the two lists are the same.&nbsp; Then loop
          through your two lists element-by-element and assert that the
          i<sup>th</sup> elements should be equal for each i. </p>
      </li>
      <li><tt>testAddIntEFront()</tt>:&nbsp; Tests adding to the
        beginning of the list.
        <p>Again, read Strings from <a href="http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~jdonalds/151/labs/test1.txt">test1.txt</a>,
          but insert each line at the front of both lists using <tt>add(index,

















            element)</tt>.&nbsp; Then verify that the lists are
          identical.<br>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><tt>testAddIntEMiddle()</tt>:&nbsp; Tests adding to the middle
        of the list.
        <p>Once more, read Strings from test1.txt.&nbsp; This time
          insert each line at the current midpoint (position size/2) of
          the list.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Write methods to test the IndexOutOfBounds exceptions on both
        borders (index -1 and index size or size+1, depending on the
        method) for the parameterized add method and the get method. </li>
    </ul>
    There you go, your very first JUnit tests!&nbsp; As you implement
    the rest of your arraylist methods, please write the accompanying
    JUnit test, and add to any previous ones.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Part 3 - Completing MyArrayList</h2>
    <h2> </h2>
    <p>Now, finish writing the public methods of your MyArrayList
      class.&nbsp; Don't forget to write (and run!) the indicated tests
      as you go along.</p>
    <h3>More public methods</h3>
    <p>Implement the following methods in your MyArrayList class:</p>
    <dl class="code">
      <dt>E set(int index, E element); </dt>
      <dd>Change the value at the specified index to element.&nbsp;
        Return the item that is being replaced. </dd>
      <dd>Throw an <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/IndexOutOfBoundsException.html">IndexOutOfBoundsException</a>
        if the index is not within the allowed range.&nbsp; Note that
        this range is smaller than the range allowed for <tt>add()</tt>.
      </dd>
      <dd>In <tt>testSet()</tt>: Create a MyArrayList of Strings and an
        ArrayList of Strings.&nbsp; Read the file <a href="http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~jdonalds/151/labs/test1.txt">test1.txt</a>
        and insert each line of the file, one at a time, into both
        lists.&nbsp; Use the<span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family:
              Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,sans-serif;"></span></span></span>
        <tt>add(element)</tt> method for your MyArrayList, but insert
        the lines into the ArrayList using <tt>add(0,element<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Verdana,sans-serif;">)</span></tt>.
        (The effect is that the two lists are in the opposite
        order.)&nbsp; Now use use <tt>get()</tt> and <tt>set()</tt> to
        reverse the order of the elements in your MyArrayList.&nbsp; The
        two lists should now be in the same order.&nbsp;</dd>
      <dd>Assert that the sizes of the two lists are the same. Then loop
        through the two lists element-by-element and assert that the i<sup>th</sup>
        elements should be equal for each i.</dd>
      <dt>E remove(int index); </dt>
      <dd>Remove the item at the specified index, shifting all other
        elements to the left.&nbsp; Return the value that was removed. </dd>
      <dd>Throw an <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/IndexOutOfBoundsException.html">IndexOutOfBoundsException</a>
        if the index is not within the allowed range. Note that this
        range is smaller than the range allowed for <tt>add()</tt>.<br>
        <br>
        In <tt>testRemove()</tt>: Read in <a href="http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~jdonalds/151/labs/test1.txt">test1.txt</a>,
        then remove every even-indexed entry, starting at 0 (that is,
        entries 0, 2, 4,... in the original list; keep in mind that
        positions change as items are removed) and add them into a
        second MyArrayList.&nbsp; Check against a standard Java
        ArrayList.<br>
      </dd>
      <dt>boolean isEmpty(); </dt>
      <dd>Return true if there are no items stored, false otherwise. <br>
        <br>
        Write your own unit test for this method.. </dd>
      <dt>void clear(); </dt>
      <dd>Empty the list.&nbsp; Be sure to allow garbage collection to
        take place by setting array entries to <code class="prettyprint
          lang-java">null</code>. <br>
        <br>
        Write your own unit test for this method. </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Efficiency Checking</h3>
    <p>Great! You are done your implementation, and you have written
      some JUnit tests to make sure that each method works. Hopefully
      everything is being added, set, and removed correctly. The last
      thing we want to quickly check is that your program is working
      efficiently. Add the following two tests to your test file
      (precede the method header with the <tt>@Test</tt> tag): </p>
    <ul class="padded">
      <li><tt>testAddEfficiency()</tt>: Create a test program that
        inserts 1,000,000 Integers starting at 1 onto the end of the
        list (using the single-parameter <tt>add</tt>). &nbsp; Every
        10,000 adds, print out the value.&nbsp; Note the speed with
        which the program completes.&nbsp; Now insert the same Integers
        but onto the front of the list.&nbsp; Does the speed
        change?&nbsp; Why or why not?
        <p>You may want to change this method's <tt>@Test</tt> tag to
          an <tt>@Ignore</tt> tag before proceeding.&nbsp; This will
          indicate to JUnit to ignore this test for the time being
          (which is good, because it takes a while to run.) </p>
      </li>
      <li><tt>testRemoveEfficiency()</tt>: As with the previous test,
        insert 1,000,000 Integers starting at 1 onto the end of the list
        (using the single-parameter <tt>add</tt>).&nbsp; Now remove all
        the elements from the back of the list (printing out the value
        every 10,000 removes). This should run quickly (and if not, take
        another look at your remove method). </li>
      <li><tt>testMemory()</tt>: Finally, create a test program that
        stores Integers and have it store values starting with 1 until
        it runs out of memory or throws an exception (use an infinite
        loop).&nbsp; Every 10,000 adds, print out the value.&nbsp; Note
        what the last value printed was.&nbsp; Now run it again telling
        it to use more memory and notice if the value changes or
        not.&nbsp; You can tell Eclipse to use more memory by clicking <b>Run







          &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; Run Configurations...</b>, clicking on the <b>Arguments</b>
        tab, and inserting <tt>-Xmx500m</tt> in the <b>VM arguments</b>
        textbox.&nbsp; Or, you can run java from the command line:
        <pre class="boxed">% <span class="typed">java -Xmx500m Test8</span></pre>
        <p> Also, pay attention to the rate at which it prints out
          numbers. Do you notice any changes? Run it again. Does it
          behave the same? Why do you think this is happening? </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please put your answers to the above questions in a <b>plain
        text file</b> named <tt>README</tt> file, and submit it with
      your lab.</p>
    <p> <b>***** After you have completed the efficiency tests, please
        put <tt>@Ignore</tt> in front of the <tt>@Test</tt> to disable
        them. *****<br>
        <br>
      </b> </p>
    <h3>Comments</h3>
    <p>For this assignment, you only need to include a block comment at
      the beginning of each of your java files, with a description of of
      the contents of the file and your name.&nbsp; If you're familiar
      with javadoc, it would be a good idea to write your comments in
      javadoc style.&nbsp; We'll be covering javadoc later in the
      course.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h2>handin</h2>
    <p> Look through your programs and make sure you've included your
      name at the top of all of them.&nbsp; If you know that there is a
      problem in one of your programs, document that at the top.&nbsp;
      If you adhered to the honor code in this assignment, add the
      following statement as a comment at the top of your <tt>README</tt>,
      <tt>MyArrayList.java</tt> and <tt>MyArrayListTest.java</tt>
      files: </p>
    <blockquote class="honor">
      <p class="centered"> <q class="honor">I have adhered to the Honor
          Code in this assignment.</q> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> <b>Quit Eclipse</b>, and then go through and <b>delete any
        *.class files</b> and backup files.&nbsp; (If you don't quit
      Eclipse first, it will keep regenerating your class files when it
      autocompiles!) </p>
    <p> You now just need to electronically handin all your files. </p>
    <pre>    % <span class="typed">cd</span>          # changes to your home directory
    % <span class="typed">cd cs151</span>    # goes to your cs151 folder
